#Alt school first semester DE Exam hands on project.pf

Hi, welcome to my first semester Data Engineering hands on project at Altschool.
The goal of this assignment is to assess your understanding of object-oriented programming
(OOP) concepts in Python. I was tasked with implementing two classes, Expense and
ExpenseDatabase, to model and manage financial expenses.
